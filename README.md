- 🔭 I'm currently working on a personal project called "Botaneer" (see it at the Soup Arcade 🍲: https://github.com/slysnivy/Soup_Arcade)
- 😪 I'm also back in contributing towards "Keep On Going" project (see it here: https://github.com/shoc71/Keep-On-Going)
- 🌱 Right now I'm learning more about pygame. In the future, I want to see how I can use it to visualize DNA/proteins or create a tool that'll make analysis easier
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any python projects, especially related to pygame or in the science fields such as biology or bioinformatics.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help in learning machine learning and AI along with their applications in science.
- 💬 Ask me about any python related issues, I'd be more than happy to help!
