## What have I worked on so far?
- 🗣️ Right now I'm learning more about pygame and how I can visually represent media
- 🐍 So far, I have created templates for video game creation and a mind map space that not only connects points, but also has a section to add a description
- 🧫 I was part of a course bioinformatics/genomics project that used Python and BASH to study genes between cancer varieties
- 🔨 I'm currently working on the continuation of a past pygame project and visually improving the mind map space program
- ✍🏻 I'm also taking the time to learn about machine learning for data analytics and analyzing biological data through edx
- ⬇️ Check out the projects that I have worked on below (more to come soon):
